# Folder Notes Lite Obsidian Plugin

This is a fork of https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes.

I tried to simplify the plugin as much as possible, that means removing options, features, and backwards compatibility. Use it at your own risk.

Here's what I changed: https://github.com/voytxt/obsidian-folder-notes-lite/compare/e0613b7d27d3ad192b1b2ea83a701af5a3bea23f...main

All of the credit for this plugin still goes to [LostPaul](https://github.com/LostPaul) under [AGPL](https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes/blob/main/LICENSE).

## How to install?

0. prerequisites: pnpm
1. clone repo to vault/.obsidian/plugins
2. run `pnpm build`
3. restart Obsidian and enable the plugin
